                <h3>Job experience...</h3>
                <p>From 2010 through 2017, I worked for PACCAR for both Kenworth Truck Company and Peterbilt Motors Company, designing and manufacturing components for the heavy duty class 8 trucks. During my time I worked on the sleeper structure, engine intake, and interiors where I designed sheet metal, extruded, cast, and injection molded components. In 2015 I transitioned to a manufacturing engineering position where I continued to support new product implementation (NPI) of cab interior products at our production facilities.</p>
                <p>I left PACCAR in 2017 to work on a project for Valve at a local contract manufacturer as a Manufacturing Engineer. Here I supported the robotic assembly of the index VR base stations, as well as the manual assembly of the knuckles controller.</p>
                <p>In January of 2019 I joined a start up in Seattle called Glowforge as a Sr. Manufacturing Engineer, where I supported the manufacture of Glowforge desktop laser cutters in Mexico, traveling 25% - 50% of my time there. </p>
